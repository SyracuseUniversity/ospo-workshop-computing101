The steps are:

1. Run `cp names.txt names-mod.txt`.

2. Run `vim names-mod.txt`

3. In vim, hit `<Ctrl>+v` to enter visual block mode.

4. Hit `G` to go to the last line. This will highlight the first column in the file. Use the right arrow to highlight the colums up to the leading whitespace. Hit `x` to cut them. Each line should now start immediately with the first name.

4. Hit `:` to enter command mode. Type `wq` (or `x`) to write then quit, then `<Enter>`. You should be back at the command line. Check your result by running `cat names-mod.txt`.
