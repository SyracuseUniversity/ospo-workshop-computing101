Type `vim add.py` to open the file, then:

1. Use the down arrow to move the cursor to the line starting with `"""`, then hit `<Shift> + V` to enter line-highlight mode. Hit the down arrow once to highlight the both the line starting with `"""` and the `a+b` line. Now hit `>` to indent the two lines.

2. Type `I` to enter insert mode. Use the direction arrows to move the cursor to the `a+b` then type `return`. Hit the escape key `<esc>` to exit insert mode.

3. Type `:` to enter command mode then type `wq` (or `x`) then `<enter>` to return to the command line.

4. Type `vim add.py` to open the file again. Use the directional arrows to move the cursor down to the `print` line. Hit `<Shift>` + `V` to enter line-highlight mode. Type `Y` to copy the line then type `P` to paste a copy of the line below. Move the cursor to highlight the first `1`  in the pasted line, then type  `<Shift>` + `R` to enter replace mode. Hit `2` then use the arrows to move to the second `1` and replace it with a `3`. Hit the escape key `<esc>` to exit replace mode, then type `:x` to save and exit.
