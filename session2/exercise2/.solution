# Note: here we give the -p flag to mkdir so that it doesn't raise an error if
# bin already exists.
mkdir -p bin
# The next block just checks if you completed exercise1; if not, it uses the
# solution there.

    cp ../exercise1/.solution ../exercise1/greeting
fi
# Answer 2

mkdir -p etc
# Note: for the next step, you could also use vim to create etc/srcgreeting.sh,
# then add the PATH command. Here, we're using $(pwd) to get the abosulte path
# of this directory. This will not work if you create the text file. Instead,
# run `pwd` on the command line to get the absoulte path of this directory,
# copy that, then paste it into the file. For example, if the absolute path of
# this directory is /some/dir, then you should have:
# PATH=/some/dir/bin:${PATH}
# in srcgreeting.sh. Also note that in the next line we have to escape the $
# (by doing \$) so that the $ gets printed in the echo command. If you're
# create the file using vim, just type $, not \$.
echo "PATH=$(pwd)/bin:\${PATH}" > etc/srcgreeting.sh
# Answer 5
