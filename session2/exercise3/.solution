# Note: here we sourced the srcgreeting.sh script in exercise 2 so that we
# can call greeting in the for loop without needing to specify its path. You
# don't need to do this. Instead, you could
# do $(bash ../exercise2/greeting ${tm}) or copy greeting to
# this directory and do $(./greeting ${tm}) in the above loop.
