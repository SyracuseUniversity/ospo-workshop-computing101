To best illustrate the changing environments, copy each of the commands below into your command line. (Note that this is not a bash script, and cannot be run.)
### Answer 1

conda create -n conda-test
```
### Answer 2
```
conda activate conda-test
conda install numpy
```
### Answer 3
```
echo $PATH
```
### Answer 4
```
./check_versions.py
```
### Answer 5
Here we're going to install the desired versions at the same time as we create the environment. This is the generally preferred way to install packages, especially when installing a specific version of Python. Otherwise, the default version of Python that came with your miniforge installation will be installed in the environment when you run `conda create`, which will then cause conflicts when you go to install it later. 
```
conda create -n conda-test2 python=3.9 numpy=1.24.1
```

```
conda activate conda-test2
./check_versions.py
