# Session 2: bash 2, Environments, and Conda

**Purpose**: Learn about UNIX permissions, variables, and environments.

## Install `conda`

Exercises 4 and 5 need `conda` to be installed. We will use the Miniconda installer. To do that, follow the instructions here: [install miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/#quick-command-line-install). Click on the tab corresponding to your operating system. **Windows users: Follow the Linux installation instructions, NOT the Windows instructions: you are installing conda under Ubuntu.** After you install, you'll need to open a new terminal window. If the installation was successful, you should see `(base)` to the left of your command prompt. This means that you're in the `base` environment.
